# Anunnaki — Agent Context

## Project Identity

A macOS knowledge management app for Sumerian/Mesopotamian mythology. Built with SwiftUI + SwiftData. Users curate structured data about deities, places, events, and sources with a native desktop UI, visual lineage trees, timelines, and natural language querying.

Product name: **Me** (displayed in window title, executable name in Package.swift). Project codename: **Anunnaki**.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI**: SwiftUI + AppKit interop (`NSTextField`, `WKWebView`)
- **Persistence**: SwiftData (`@Model`, `@Query`, `ModelContext`)
- **Dependencies**: None external (stdlib only: SwiftUI, SwiftData, AppKit, WebKit, Foundation)
- **Platform**: macOS 14+ only
- **Build**: Swift Package Manager (`swift build` / `swift test`)

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
swift build
swift test
swift run                          # launches the app
swift run Me --reseed              # force re-seed database from seed_data.json
```

## Data Seeding

- `SeedData.seedIfEmpty(context:)` is called in `ContentView.onAppear` via `.task` — not in `App.init()` — so the app window opens immediately with a "Seeding database…" progress view.
- Re-seeding: pass `--reseed` as a launch argument to wipe all existing data and re-import from `seed_data.json`. In Xcode: Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments → add `--reseed` to "Arguments Passed on Launch".
- `SeedData.clearAll(context:)` deletes all entities in dependency order (associations first, then root entities).
- Existing figures (28), 21 new SKL dynasty eras, 10 SKL places, 10 father-son relationships — 162 total figures.
- **Migration-safe seeding**: When adding a new `@Model` entity to the schema after the store has already been seeded, lightweight migration adds the table but the seed function skips (because `figureCount > 0`). Use `ensureTypesExist(context:)` (or similar per-entity helper) to backfill missing seed data. This is called in the early-return path of `seedIfEmpty` so new entities are always populated.

## Data Model (all `@Model final class`)

| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| **Figure** | Deity, human, primordial | name, figureType, gender, domain, birth/deathDate, figureDescription |
| **Relationship** | Family/creator links | fromFigure→toFigure, relationshipType (.father/.mother/.spouse/.sibling/.creator etc.) |
| **Place** | City, temple, realm, etc. | name, placeType, modernLocation, latitude, longitude |
| **Event** | Mythological event | name, eventType, date, involvedFigures[], place |
| **Era** | Timeline period | name, orderIndex, startDate, endDate |
| **Source** | Reference work | name, sourceType, author, language, period, url |
| **Citation** | Source→entity link | source, location, entityType, linkedEntityName |
| **Attachment** | URL/file on a Source | source, title, url, attachmentType |
| **AlternateName** | Cross-cultural alias | figure, name, tradition (.sumerian/.akkadian/.greek/etc.), nameType |
| **FigurePlaceAssociation** | Figure↔Place with role | figure, place, role (.patronDeity/.ruler/.worshippedAt/etc.) |
| **PlacePlaceAssociation** | Place↔Place link | fromPlace→toPlace, role (.locatedWithin/.nearTo/etc.) |
| **FigureType** | Dynamic type for figures | name, icon, colorHex (replaces hardcoded `Figure.FigureType` enum) |
| **EventType** | Dynamic type for events | name, icon, colorHex (replaces hardcoded `Event.EventType` enum) |
| **PlaceType** | Dynamic type for places | name, icon, colorHex (replaces hardcoded `Place.PlaceType` enum) |
| **EventEventAssociation** | Event↔Event link | fromEvent→toEvent, role (.caused/.motivated/.precedes/.contradicts/.parallels) |
| **FigureImage** | Image attached to figure | figure, filename, caption, source |
| **MythologicalDate** | Struct (not @Model) | year (Int?, negative=BCE), era, isApproximate |

## Architecture Patterns

- **List-Detail split**: All list views (Figures, Places, Events, Sources) use an `HStack` with a selectable list on the left and a detail panel on the right (320pt wide).
- **CRUD forms**: Each entity has a `FormView` (e.g., `FigureFormView`) used for both add and edit via `.sheet(isPresented:)`.
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Used in Figure/Place/Event list views for history-based back navigation (`BreadcrumbBar`).
- **Color/icon extensions**: Each enum type has extensions providing `color` and `icon` (SF Symbols) for consistent UI rendering.
- **Dossier pattern**: `QueryEngine` builds "dossiers" (e.g., `FigureDossier`) bundling all related data (parents, children, spouses, events, places, citations) for the query and detail views.
- **Seed on launch (async)**: `SeedData.seedIfEmpty()` is called from `ContentView.task` — shows a loading indicator while seeding.
- **Natural Language Query**: `QueryEngine` parses possessive patterns ("X's children"), prepositional patterns ("children of X"), question prefixes ("what do we know about X"), and direct entity lookup.
- **Wikipedia Import**: `WikiClient` fetches search results, extracts, Wikidata IDs and entities. `WikidataParser` maps Wikidata QIDs to model enums. Import auto-matches to existing entities or creates a new Source.

## Coding Conventions

- **Comments**: None in source files (agent should not add comments).
- **Naming**: Swift conventions (camelCase properties, PascalCase types). Models use `figureDescription`, `eventDescription`, `placeDescription` (not `desc`).
- **SwiftUI**: Use `@Query` for fetches, `@Environment(\.modelContext)` for mutations. Prefer `NavigationSplitView` with sidebar.
- **Optional strings**: Default to `""` not `nil` for string fields. Optional `PersistentIdentifier` for selection state.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Tuple type `[(id: PersistentIdentifier, name: String)]` consistent across list views.
- **SwiftData**: Inverse relationships specified with `@Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: ...)`.
- **Shared container**: `MeApp.sharedContainer` is a static property on the `@main` App struct, allowing direct access to the `ModelContainer` from anywhere (useful for debugging or bypassing environment inheritance issues).
- **Mock data**: `SeedData` uses private Codable structs mirroring the entities (e.g., `SeedFigure`, `SeedEvent`).
- **No external packages** — all dependencies are Apple SDKs.

## Session Log

### 2026-06-18 — Section headers, SKL view, delete confirmations, icon transparency

**Changes made:**
- `Sources/Me/Views/DisplayRow.swift` — Created `DisplayRow<Entity>` shared type with `DisplayItem` enum for section headers in sorted lists
- `Sources/Me/Views/FigureListView.swift` — Section headers (name→first letter, type→type name, domain→domain, date→era), delete confirmation alert
- `Sources/Me/Views/PlaceListView.swift` — Section headers + delete confirmation alert
- `Sources/Me/Views/EventListView.swift` — Section headers + delete confirmation alert
- `Sources/Me/Views/EraListView.swift` — Delete confirmation alert
- `Sources/Me/Views/SumerianKingListView.swift` — New file: grouped by dynasty, reign parsing via `SKLReignLength`, colorized `"N kings"` and `"Duration: X years"` labels
- `Sources/MeCore/Models/SKLReignLength.swift` — New file: `ReignLength` struct + `parse(from:)` using regex pattern `"Reigned\\s+([\\d,]+)\\s+years"`
- `Sources/Me/Views/AlternateNameListView.swift` — Replaced figure `Picker` with search text field + filtered list; filter bar picker → text field
- `Sources/Me/Views/AlternateNameFormView.swift` — Search-based figure selector (text field + filtered scroll list) matching EventFormView pattern
- `Sources/Me/Views/ContentView.swift` — Added `SidebarSection.history`, `NavigationItem.sumerianKingList`, sidebar section between Visualizations and Data
- `Sources/Me/AnunnakiApp.swift` — Changed `Bundle.main` → `Bundle.module` for app icon resource loading
- `Sources/Me/Resources/AppIcon.png` — Corner transparency fixed: 22% rounded-rect mask applied (pixels beyond quarter-circle radius set to alpha=0)
- `Sources/Me/Resources/AppIcon.icns` — Regenerated from fixed PNG (all required sizes via iconset)

**Icon fix (known issue):** The Swift script sets corner pixels with `dist > cornerRadius` to A=0, but creates a hard cutoff. The icon may look jagged at small sizes. Need a proper approach: either use `NSImage` with `cornerRadius` mask or a proper image editor. The fix is a starting point but makes corners transparent instead of opaque as before.

**Relevant new/removed files:**
- `Sources/Me/Views/DisplayRow.swift` — Added
- `Sources/Me/Views/SumerianKingListView.swift` — Added
- `Sources/MeCore/Models/SKLReignLength.swift` — Added

### 2026-06-22 — Resizable detail panel dividers across all 6 list views

**Changes made:**
- `Sources/Me/Views/ResizableDivider.swift` — New reusable component: draggable vertical divider with cursor change (`NSCursor.resizeLeftRight`) and `DragGesture` for resizing detail panel width.
- `Sources/Me/Views/FigureListView.swift` — Replaced `Divider()` and `.frame(width: 320)` with `ResizableDivider` and `@AppStorage("figureDetailWidth")`.
- `Sources/Me/Views/PlaceListView.swift` — Same change with `@AppStorage("placeDetailWidth")`.
- `Sources/Me/Views/EventListView.swift` — Same change with `@AppStorage("eventDetailWidth")`.
- `Sources/Me/Views/SourceListView.swift` — Same change with `@AppStorage("sourceDetailWidth")`.
- `Sources/Me/Views/EraListView.swift` — Same change with `@AppStorage("eraDetailWidth")`.
- `Sources/Me/Views/SumerianKingListView.swift` — Same change with `@AppStorage("sklDetailWidth")`.

**Design decisions:**
- `@AppStorage` (Double) persists widths per view across launches.
- Drag range clamped to 200–800pt to prevent collapsing or over-expanding.
- Each view stores its own key so Figure, Place, Event, Source, Era, and SKL panels have independent widths.
- `ResizableDivider` uses `NSCursor.resizeLeftRight` on hover for native macOS feel.
- Minimum drag distance of 5pt prevents accidental activation.

**Relevant new/removed files:**
- `Sources/Me/Views/ResizableDivider.swift` — Added

### 2026-06-22 — Design note: `Relationship.source` as lineage discriminator

**The idea:** Different source texts (Enuma Elish, Atra-Hasis, SKL, Epic of Gilgamesh, etc.) each provide their own genealogical accounts, often contradictory. The `Relationship.source` string (already present, free-text) can serve as a discriminator to show separate lineage trees per source tradition, rather than merging all relationships into one monolithic tree.

**Open questions (need more thought):**
- Should lineage views get a source picker (e.g., "All Sources" / "Enuma Elish" / "Sumerian King List") that filters relationships by `source`?
- Or should `source` be promoted from a free-text string to a `@Relationship` to the `Source` model for referential integrity?
- How to display contradictions explicitly (e.g., "Enuma Elish says X is father of Y, but Atra-Hasis says Z is father of Y")?
- Should `QueryEngine`/natural language queries also respect source discrimination?
- Does `MiniLineageView` need the filter, or only the full-tree views?
- The `Citation` model already provides polymorphic entity→Source linking — should `Relationship` use it instead of/in addition to the string field?

**Current state (baseline):** All three lineage views (`LineageTreeView`, `FigureLineageExplorer`, `MiniLineageView`) query all relationships with no source predicate. The `source` string is displayed in `RelationshipListView` and `FigureDetailView` but unused for filtering.

### 2026-06-20 — Fix massive top padding in Pre-Flood timeline

**Changes made:**
- `Sources/Me/Views/TimelinePreView.swift` — Changed `ScrollView([.horizontal, .vertical])` to `ScrollView(.vertical)`. Dual-axis ScrollView in SwiftUI centers content in both axes when content is smaller than the viewport, creating massive top/bottom padding. Single-axis `.vertical` keeps content top-aligned. Pre-flood doesn't need outer horizontal scrolling (mythological swimlanes have their own internal horizontal scroll).
- `AGENTS.md` — Added Debugging Visual Layout Issues section with layered `.background()` procedure.

## Debugging Visual Layout Issues

When investigating SwiftUI layout bugs (unexpected padding, misalignment, sizing), follow this procedure:

1. **Add a colored `.background()` to the outermost view first**, then run to observe which view claims the full frame.
2. **Work inward layer by layer**, moving the background color one level deeper each time, until you isolate which view has the unexpected size or position.
3. Only after identifying the root view should you look at modifier chains or data flow.

This is faster and more reliable than reading code to simulate the layout engine.

### 2026-06-23 — Enoch Archangels backfill

**Problem:** Archangels section missing in EnochView for existing databases. `ensureTypesExist` gates FigureType creation on `figureTypeCount == 0`, so types added later (Archangel, Igigi, Commander) are never backfilled. `ensureEnochDataExists` early-returns if Mount Hermon exists, preventing any archangel creation.

**Fix:** Added `Migration.ensureArchangelsExist(context:)` — creates the Archangel FigureType if missing (same pattern as `ensureCommanderFigureTypeExists`), then creates the 7 archangel figures (Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Saraqael, Remiel) by name if absent. Called at the top of `ensureEnochDataExists` before the Mount Hermon guard, so it runs on every launch.

**Lesson:** Any entity or type added to `seed_data.json` after the first public build needs a `Migration.swift` backfill for existing databases. Never rely solely on the fresh-seed path.

### 2026-06-24 — Lineage ambiguity: collapse to 1 per type + alternative badges

**Problem:** When multiple relationships of the same parent type exist (e.g., two "Mother" entries for the same figure), all four lineage views rendered them side-by-side — confusing for contradictory traditions. The `isPreferred` flag existed but wasn't used for collapsing.

**Changes made:**
- `FigureLineageExplorer.swift` — Replaced `preferred()` + `altCounts()` with unified `resolveGeneration()` returning `(figures, alts)`. Added `resolvedParents`/`parentAlts`, `resolvedChildren`/`childAlts`, `resolvedGrandparents`/`grandparentAlts`, `resolvedGrandchildren`/`grandchildAlts`. Updated `generationRow` to accept `alts` + `onSelectAlt`. All callers pass alts dict.
- `LineageTreeView.swift` — Same pattern with parameterized methods (`parentsAndAlts(of:)`, `childrenAndAlts(of:)`, `grandparentsAndAlts(of:)`, `grandchildrenAndAlts(of:)`). Updated `generationRow` and all callers.
- `LineageExplorerWindow.swift` — Same instance-property pattern as FigureLineageExplorer. Added `resolveGeneration()`, resolved properties, updated `generationRow` and callers.
- `MiniLineageView.swift` — Fixed build error (stale `preferredParent()` calls → `parents(typeName:of:from:).preferred`). Then extracted `ParentChipView` struct so father/mother each own their `@State` for the popover (previously shared state caused empty popover). Moved `.popover` from `HStack` to the `+N` button itself. Removed intermediate `popoverFigures` copy — reads `alternatives` directly.

**Key design decisions:**
- All lineage views consistently use `resolveGeneration()` to collapse to ≤1 figure per type.
- Alternatives shown as `+N` badge → popover listing alternatives → click navigates/recenters.
- `resolveGeneration()` returns both the filtered figures AND an alternatives dictionary, avoiding redundant computations.
- `FigureCardView` already supported `alternatives` + `onSelectAlt` — lineage views just needed to pass them through.

**Relevant files:**
- `Sources/Me/Views/FigureLineageExplorer.swift` — Updated
- `Sources/Me/Views/LineageTreeView.swift` — Updated (includes `FigureCardView`)
- `Sources/Me/Views/LineageExplorerWindow.swift` — Updated
- `Sources/Me/Views/MiniLineageView.swift` — Updated + `ParentChipView` extracted

## Hard Constraints

- **NO reseeding.** Never run `--reseed`, never call `clearAll`, never destroy user data. All migrations must be additive only (check-by-name before creating). The user's existing database is sacred.

## Interaction Guidelines (from CONTRIBUTING.md)

- One change per request. Split large tasks into small steps.
- Validate JSON with `jq --exit-status . Sources/Resources/seed_data.json` before committing seed changes.
- Run `swift build` before submitting changes.
- Branch naming: `feat/`, `bugfix/`, `migration/` prefixes.
- Do not commit secrets, keys, or provisioning profiles.
